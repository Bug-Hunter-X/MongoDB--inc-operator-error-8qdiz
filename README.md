# MongoDB $inc Operator Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value. However, providing a string value instead of a number will lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.js` file contains the incorrect code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
